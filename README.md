# Implementing instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN
The Mask R-CNN architecture helps in identifying / highlighting the instances of objects of a given class within an image. This comes in especially handy when there are multiple objects of the same type present within the image. Furthermore, the term Mask represents the segmentation that's done at the pixel level by Mask R-CNN.
